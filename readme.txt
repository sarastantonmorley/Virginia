Portfolio Export Instructions
---------------------------------------------------
In order to view this portfolio correctly, all files within this ZIP file need to be extracted first into another directory / folder.

1) Create a new folder and folder name on your local hard-drive.
2) Extract All files into this folder by clicking on the top menu 'File' , then 'Extract All'.  Then select which folder to extract all the files to.

Or you can extract files by using a utility program such as WinZip. (www.winzip.com)

*PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL FILES ARE WITHIN THE SAME FOLDER *

3) Once extracted, to view the portfolio just click on 'index.html' - which is the front page of the portfolio. 

The portfolio will be viewable just as it is online by clicking the necessary menu items, buttons and links.

TO CREATE A CD:

Ensure you extract all files from the ZIP file (as above) into the root of the CD.  (You may wish to extract all files to a local directory first, before copying onto a CD). 

When placed in a CD drive the CD will 'autorun' and open the front page of the portfolio automatically.
